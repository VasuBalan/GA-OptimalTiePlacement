# GA-OptimalTiePlacement
This program computes the optimal tie switch position for two different system such as 15-bus distribution system and 69-bus distribution system.  Please refer the following paper for more information "Reliability improvement of reconfigurable distribution system using GA and PSO" 

This program contain two sepereate program :

1) Inside Rarfile - represent the optimal tie switch identification for 15-bus distribution system.
2) Other program represent the optimal tie switch identification for 69-bus distribution system.

Both the system uses two types of loading : Equal and unequal loadings.
